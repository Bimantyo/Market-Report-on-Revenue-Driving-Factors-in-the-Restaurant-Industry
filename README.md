# :chart_with_upwards_trend: Market Report on Revenue Driving Factors in the Restaurant Industry

Hello! I‚Äôm Bima, this project aims to analyze the key factors influencing restaurant revenue through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), providing business insights and strategic recommendations to support growth and performance improvement.

Adopting an end-to-end approach, I worked not only as a Data Analyst but also simulated the role of a Data Engineer. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, was treated as if it were retrieved from a real production database to reflect an industry-level workflow.

The data pipeline was built using ElasticSearch for database management and Apache Airflow to automate and schedule data ingestion. Once the data was stored and organized, I performed EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights for informed business decision-making.

## :eyes: Problem Background

According to Detik Bali, the Food and Beverage (F&B) sector refers to businesses that focus on food and drink. It is one of the most widely pursued industries due to its vast market potential. As food and beverages are primary human needs, interest in this sector is consistently high. However, this high demand also drives intense competition among F&B business owners.

Citing esb.id, the potential failure rate for culinary businesses in Indonesia can reach as high as 90%. This aligns with data from the National Restaurant Association‚Äîa leading U.S. restaurant industry body representing over 380,000 restaurant locations‚Äîwhich estimates that only 20% of restaurants succeed. Meanwhile, 60% fail within their first year of operation, and 80% close within five years of opening.

The F&B industry, including restaurants, is highly dynamic and can undergo rapid changes in a short period. To build a long-lasting F&B business, it is essential to optimize food quality, management, service, and innovation. Implementing effective and efficient business strategies can maximize potential and improve operational performance. Conversely, poor, ineffective, or inefficient strategies can result in significant financial losses and negative customer reviews. One example of a failed restaurant due to poor business strategy is Karen‚Äôs Diner.

## üìä Project Highlights

- Selecting the right restaurant location is critical, as establishments situated in densely populated areas generally generate higher revenue compared to those in less populated regions.
- Allocating a larger marketing budget often leads to increased social media engagement and follower growth, which can, in turn, attract more customers and potentially boost revenue through greater campaign reach and brand awareness.

## :computer: Data

The data source used comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anthonytherrien/restaurant-revenue-prediction-dataset)

The dataset contains 17 columns and a total of 8368 rows. No duplicate entries were found nor missing values.
